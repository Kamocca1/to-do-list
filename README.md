# Restaurant Page

Welcome to the **Restaurant Page** project!  
This project is a practice exercise in DOM manipulation, where the goal is to dynamically render a restaurant homepage using **JavaScript alone**â€”no static HTML for the main content!

## Project Goals

-   Practice manipulating the DOM with JavaScript
-   Dynamically generate all website content (except the HTML shell)
-   Learn about modular JavaScript and project structure

## Features

-   Home, Menu, and About sections rendered dynamically
-   Responsive layout and navigation
-   All content generated via JavaScript

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Kamocca1/restaurant-page.git
    cd restaurant-page
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server:**
    ```
